# ZenitGateKeeper - Android alarm keypad for home automation .

Android application used as an alarm triggering keypad for arming/disarming alarm via a homeautomation system. The idea is to use an wall mounted android phone to arm and disarm my Fibaro home alarm.

Notice that this application has only been tested with a Fibaro HC2 system, but in theory it should be able to work with other systems as well. 

See wiki for more information.

It is tested on a devices running android 5, 6 and 7
